# horiseon

## Description

This project was built to refactor the HTML and CSS for the Horiseon webpage. The HTML was enhanced for search engine optimization and accessibility through semantic HTML tags. The CSS was updated to include the semantic HTML tags and was cleaned up to remove unnecessary selectors. CSS selectors were also combined when possible.

I learned how to make HTML and CSS files easier to read and learned how to incorporate semantic HTML for SEO and accessibility purposes.
